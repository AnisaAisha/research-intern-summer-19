I used the programming practices learnt in OOP (classes) to develop my solution.
I researched a lot on PPM images and read the documentation, and found 2 methods to construct them, using an image array with a pixel struct or directly writing to the file.
My code is organized as i've inserted the following features clearly (which were required):
I've inserted checks which check if the input is valid or not
The output image is in plain PPM format (P3) and is only in uppercase letters.
Colors for the text and background can both be manually set by using different RGB values.
