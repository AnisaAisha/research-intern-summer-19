## Say My Name
Write a C++ program that inputs a name from command line and outputs a file, `name.ppm`, which contains the name. See the image below for an example.

<img width="208" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13131021/57966541-3953c000-7908-11e9-95eb-f91af5d9bc5e.png">

The input name
- must not contain spaces,
- contains letters of the English alphabet only,
- may be in mixed case, and
- can be of arbitrary length up to 24 characters.

The output image
- must be in [plain PPM format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm_format),
- may use any color scheme,
- must contain upper case characters only,
- may use any font, and
- must contain text in a readable size.

## Submission
- _Fork_ this repository,
- create a folder in your fork called `solution-<pseudonym>`, e.g. `solution-fluttershine`, (this is to maintain anonymity),
- develop your solution in the folder,
- include a `README` in the folder that contains
    - a short explanation of how your submission satisfies each of the required traits
    - your contact information that does not reveal your identity, and
- submit a _pull request_ to this repository.

The pull request - there should be only one per candidate - should be made by 23:59:59 on 31 May, 2019 [UTC](https://www.space.com/what-is-utc.html).

## Evaluation
I will evaluate your submission against the criteria mentioned above. The submission that best fits will be selected. All candidates will be notified, using the instructions in their `README`, of their outcome by 23:59:59 on 7 June, 2019 UTC.

## Queries
I believe the above instructions are sufficient for the task. If some important points are unspecified, that is by design. See the criterion above on exercising judgment. When making a decision, be sure to evaluate it against the given criteria.
